The Maloney Quaker Connection

The Maloney line has been a difficult line to research, but until I dug into the research, very little was known about this family and it’s origins. Many people have been reluctant to talk about any history of this family and or have not been interested in it’s origins.
To date, we still have not made the Irish connection, although any number of family members will tell you the “name is Irish and their grandfather came over from Ireland”. The truth is John Maloney is five generations back and all his desc endants were born in Kentucky.		We are not sure if John himself was also born in the states. The records become very scarce after the 1800’s and so far we have not been able to connect him to Ireland. This line has not revealed any preference of religion, and the dysfunction from intermarrying in the secluded area of Breathitt County, Kentucky shows more confusion and chaos than any of the lines I have researched. The other related lines that I researched very little, include the Bryant line. our great gran dfather, Mcdonaldson married Sabrina Bryant.	I was sent some information about this line from a man who was doing extensive research in order to establish this line to one of Daniel Boone’s sisters.	I have not verified this line as well, but if this is c orrect, it will again connect us to a Quaker line, for the Bboone’s came from England and were Quakers .

I print for you here a copy of the information that was sent to me by a
