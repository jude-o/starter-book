EULOGY FOR WANDA

Oct 19 2005
Delivered by Howard Murray Huddleston

Proverbs 31:10-15, 17-21, 25-31


Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies.
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
She seeketh woold, and flax and worketh willingly with her hands.
She is like a merchant’s ship and bringeth her food from afar.
She ariseth also while it is yet light and and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
She girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms.
She percieveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou exceelest them all.
Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but the woman who feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.
Give her the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.


My sister Wanda, was truly a Virtuous woman-I'd like to tell you about some of her greatest virtues:

Hard Working
Started Young - Paper Route, Ironing Money, Blue jean Creases.	She had 10 children and cared for them and the grandchildren And never said no. She was a perfectionist in all she did. We all have some of her wood creations, made with skill and love.

Generous
We all have experienced Wanda's willingness to prepare big meals-our family experienced this in Florida one year-she had a big lasagna dinner waiting for us when we got to the house late one evening. She always shared her home and what she had.

Humble
Wanda always gave help to others but was always quiet about it and never sought any recognition or even appreciation.

Devoted to Family
While Wanda and Taylor lived in Florida she had the coffee table piled with photo albums of her
children and grandchildren.	They were her life.	She showed her love to all of us in very practical ways. Wanda was wise and a good listener.	She gave good advice to her children and grandchildren
And prayed for all of them to live Godly lives.


Courageous & Strong
Wanda truly showed us all how to be strong and courageous in difficult circumstances. She faced serious health problems for at least 20 years. In the past couple of years she was a real fighter and suffered painful treatments to survive.
 

We have truly been blessed by God for having her as a sister, wife, mother, grandmother, and friend. We can use her example and honor her by living virtuous lives. This song expresses how I feel we should all live in the coming Days:
"Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage Your mighty Defender is always the same. Mount up with wings, as the eagle ascending Victory is sure when you call on His name.

So put on the armor the Lord has provided And place your defense in His unfailing care. Trust Him, for He will be with you in battle. Lighting your path to avoid every snare.

Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage Your mighty Commander will vanquish the foe. Fear not the battle, for the victory is always His. He will protect you wherever you go."
 


Wanda & Taylor's 50th 
Wedding Poem

by Mark Spahn


One day in spring when our eyes met Words didn't need to be spoken
A union was planned by God
And our vows were never to be broken


 


-..
 
There were to be many hard times And many burdens would test our love
At times we would bend, but we never broke Like the perfect fit, we are a hand in glove.


Throught the years we had many children And raised them the best we could
If asked would we do it over again
answer is, without a doubt we would!
i;
 

gs began to change rerf$r:	'[ng families of their own
skipping a beat
ore filled our home.


gone by now
nand done

In Indiana on August 21, 1928 Wanda Mae Huddleston was born. Her father was a professional artist. He provided for his family through his creative talent as a portrait painter. Wanda was one of thirteen children in her family.

I've been told that Wanda was the first girl to deliver newspaper in her town. It was on her paper route that her life took a surprising turn. One of her patrons was the Maloney family. Young Taylor Hershel Maloney had just returned from the WWII as a staff Sergeant. He served our country in 7 major campaigns including Normandy's D Day. She was 18, he was 24. As the newspaper was being delivered one day he saw this beautiful young girl. He asked his parents who this enterprising girl was. Nearly a month passed and Taylor's father got sick. Taylor was asked to run the store. Wanda came into the store one day to trade for food.
Taylor claims that he fell in love with her the first time they talked. They got briefly acquainted; he invited her to the fair. That must have been a very special fair because ten days later they were married. They were
married by a preacher at his father's house.
Taylor's oldest sister was married at the same time with them.

And, as they say, the rest is history. On August 31s' of this year they celebrated their 59th Anniversary.

They soon began their family -. which eventually boasted 10 children, 32 grandchildren, and 31 great grandchildren.

Wanda was always busy. She worked both in and out of the home. She was the primary care giver to the children, keeping the home clean and the kids nurtured, loved, and cared for.
She was a crossing-guard for the neighborhood school, she delivered Newspapers, worked at the Election Polls, took in Ironing. She baby-sat eleven kids in her home, even after having 10 of her own.
Wanda Maloney's life was all about her husband, children, and grandchildren. Their house was always the hub of all kinds of activities. Their table was always welcoming to any friend or stranger that happened by. Someone once called the Maloney home the "Kool-Aid" home because all the neighborhood children knew they could find a snack and drink there.

Her children will all remember her delicious Cherry Cobbler. Trips to the Pony keg for chocolate malts, peanut butter fudge, popcorn balls and apples. Each Friday held a special treat. Wanda would rifle through the pockets of her husband's pants for money as he was sleeping and she would take the kids out to the bakery and buy fresh-made donuts. Each time she would cautiously remind her children, "Don't tell Dad."
Wanda was not your run-of-the-mill type of mother. How do I know? What other mother do you know who kept her band-saw in her kitchen? That's right. Band Saw. You might have noticed in the northex that Wanda was a (crafts-woman) who loved to work with wood. One Christmas she asked her children for one gift alone ... a Band Saw. Where would a woman keep her band saw? Well, where it was convenient to use, of course ... the kitchen.
 

I can only imagine that after the breakfast dishes were cleared one could hear the buzz of the saw, chiseling out the shape of a horse or paddle-boat. Wanda made many gifts of love and skill and gave them to her family and friends. Cherish these things.

The children of Wanda Maloney pretty much all agree that their mother was on mission to spoil their children. Oh, how did Wanda love her grandchildren and her great grandchildren! She would rise early to make her famous French Toast for breakfast for them. She would sneak snacks and cater in any way she could to her grandchildren. There was always a game available to play or a picture ready to be colored. She was always ready for a game of cards, Yatzee, 500 Rummy, Dominoes - Chicken Foot. Even when she was alone you could find her playing her hand held Yatzee game. SHE NEVER WAS IDLE.

 







pragmatic and practical.
 
Wanda never saw a stranger. She would have conversations with anyone she met. Sometimes ",spilling the beans" of whatever was happening in her life. She always befriended everyone. She loved people.
Wanda loved Lighthouses and Thomas Kincade paintings. Wanda was a strong woman who spoke her mind. She was a realist and very
 

Thirteen years ago another milestone took place in her life, which change the direction of her path. At a Christmas program, here in this church sanctuary, she knelt at an altar of prayer and received Jesus Christ as her personal Savior and Lord.

The Wanda Maloney I knew these past few years was a strong woman of faith. She trusted in God to meet her need. She was always grateful to the Lord for his provisions in her life.

She was quick to praise God and to express her love for Christ. Some of her final words here on earth were the uttering of "Hallelujah, Hallelujah!” as all of the family members gathered in her room for one final farewell before she died.

A few months after their conversion, both Wanda and Taylor were baptized in the Christian Faith. Children, your mother was a strong woman and a tenacious fighter. We could especially see her determination these past few weeks. She fought for every day, every breath.

This past week you gave your mother a very precious gift. As you surrounded her in her hospice room you gave her permission to let go. You reminded her that she had fought a good fight. You let her know that it was OK for her to rest in the arms of Jesus.

From that moment we saw Wanda Maloney slip from this world to the next. She is now at home in heaven. Jesus tells us that he has gone to prepare a place for us ... a mansion. She has seen Jesus face to face. We can be sure that she is in a better place.

Let it be said of her that she loved and adored her family.
 
Wanda was first baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints by her father and considered herself a member as she stated to Sharon until her death in 2005. She was not active throughout her life in this or any other church, but her kind and tender spirit is evidence of her love of the Savior regardless of any particular beliefs.

How we live our lives and keep our covenants is what sets us apart from the rest of the world. For various reasons, my mother’s focus of spiritual matters had been broken and her testimony of Christ was not nutured during her marriage to our father, nor were religious values taught to us.	Nonetheless, my most important and earliest memories of my mother was of her reading the Bible to us at a very young age and the next important memory is when some men from a neighboring church had stopped by to visit and encourage religious teachings in our home.	They asked if they could do anything for the family, and mom told them that I was sick. They asked if they could pray over me and ask for a blessing for me. I will never forget the feelings and stirrings of belief in the Savior from the experiences of Mom reading the bible and having someone pray for me. Thus began my desire to know more about the Savior and his teachings.

Paragraphs from my personal Journal 1999

My mother was seriously ill two months ago and I was called to come in case these were to be her final moments on this earth. We were all so worried about her and I anticipated a funeral while I was there. Miraculously, she recovered and so my sisters and I could relax a bit and enjoy one another's company. I live a great distance from my sisters and they are fun people to be around. They wanted to do things to celebrate the change of circumstances in my mothers’ health by going to the beach on Sunday. As we sat at dinner that Saturday evening and discussed plans for the following day I realized that I needed to make it understood that I would not be joining them that I intended to go to Church instead. Inside my heart I struggled so much with wanting to be a part of their festivities as well as have their acceptance. Years and miles and differences of opinion had separated us for so long and I desired to be in their company and enjoy our sisterhood, but I promptly asked my mother for the name of her home teacher and made arrangements to get to church.	The next day was a spiritually enlightening one for me and the Spirit testified to me all during the meetings that I was doing the right thing by honoring my covenant with the Lord by keeping the Sabbath day holy.

I did not realize until a few days later how this would impact my mother. She took note of the difference in how I observed Sunday. My mother had just had a miraculous recovery from a serious illness due to a priesthood blessing and I think she was realizing her neglectfulness in showing appreciation to the Lord for this blessing. After everyone had left and she and I had some quiet time to talk, she said to me- "I should have gone to church with you on Sunday." She did not say- I should have gone to the beach with my sisters where they had a fun day and enjoyed each other’s company, but I should have gone to church with you.	She saw a need to make changes in her life and made a commitment to do so, while I was there.	A standard had been noted. The spirit continues to testify to me how important it is for me to continue to keep my covenants to remember Him and to keep the Sabbath day holy and to be obedient to His commandments, for this is how we continue to remember and show our love to Him.”

Deuteronomy 7:9

Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.
