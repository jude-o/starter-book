#A Legacy of Faith

As I begin this journey back in time and history of our ancestors, I think it important to know their religious beliefs since this is the best way of measuring how they lived. This legacy of faith comes in large part because of our Quaker heritage. I found that besides the Huddleston’s there were two other Quaker lines, The Cox’s and Cadwallader’s that eventually marry into the Huddleston line as well as one Quaker line that ties into the Maloney line.

Leah Huddleston had provided a few photos of the Cox line and so I decided to focus on this line exclusively one day. After an all day search on the internet, I had been able to go back a couple of generations, identifying Martha Cox’s parents in the census records. When I took a break for dinner and enthusiastically shared my finds with Nolan, I was anxious to get back to see if I could find any more information on this family. What a delightful surprise to find exactly what I was looking for on “rootsweb” in the form of a Cox Family Bible.
This information took me back another generation. I was so delighted to get this info, that I quickly sent an e-mail of ecstatic thank you’s to the publisher. He was very kind to write back and say – Well. If you enjoyed that- wait till you see what else I have to send you . He promptly e-mailed several pages of information from “The Cox Family in America” which took the Cox line all the way back to the foundation of this country. The
Cox family had imigrated from England and settled in the Long Island or as it was called anciently Matinecock, Oyster Bay” area of New York. Because they were Quakers, information about birth, death, and marriages were recorded because of the inspiration that George Fox, their leader, received during an imprisonment for his beliefs. He received inspiration that meetings of “Friends” should also be recorded.

Our country was founded on religious freedom. Until Catholic teachings were challenged they dominated the beliefs of ancient people and the teachings of the Bible were taught by the priests who were educated to know and understand the workings and interpretations of God. Martin Luther was the first to challenge these teachings, and from that time forward many other people were also “enlightened” from their readings and understandings from their reading of the Bible. One of those enlightened individuals was George Fox, who formed the Quaker faith. “This Sect was not originally called Quakers but were known and referred to themselves as “Children of the Light or simply “Friends.” Persecutors called them Quakers in derision, but they accepted the name, believing that one should approach the Almighty with awe. George Fox, one of the founders of this sect attributed the name “Quaker” to a Justice Derby who used the term in 1650 when Fox bade him “Tremble at the word of the Lord.” The central teaching of the Quakers is that each person is enlightened by the divine Light of Christ. Quakers were able to gather people of diverse views who could agree on the basic belief of an inner light.”

Coming to this country to worship in whatever fashion you desired, was not an absolute guarantee, as there was extreme prejudice against some sects. The Quaker faith was one of them.
