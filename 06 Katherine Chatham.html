            <h2>Katherine Chatham</h2>

<p>(Huddleston Family Tables)
Our Great Grandmother, Katherine Chatham was also persecuted for her Quaker beliefs. The following is information is taken from the Huddleston Family tables and was researched by Samuel and his cousin, George Huddleston about Catherine and Valentine Huddleston.</p>

<p>“Yet a word or two of Katherine Chatham of whom I have made mention in the margin of what hath been said before. She came from London through many trials and hard travels to Boston and appeared clothed with sackcloth as a sign of the indignation of the Lord coming upon you in the weight and sense of which she came there and appeared for which instead of coming to a sense of your condition and what was coming upon you in the burden of which she came so far and through such hardship. You laid hand upon her and put her in prison out of which you would give no deliverance until with the seven and twenty aforesaid you drove her out with sword and club into the wilderness and that was the reward you gave her for her love in coming so amongst you.    And such was your rage and cruelty to her that at Dudham she was not only whipped but the man that was with her and traveled together though you had little to say to him. After this she coming to Boston again you imprisoned her a long season there to pay a fine you laid upon her thinking to be rid of her that way in cold winter and sad extremities and sickness near to death but the Lord otherwise provided for her and disappointed you for she was took to wife by John Chamberlaine and so became an inhabitant of Boston.”</p>

<p>Valentine Huddleston immigrated to Maryland about 1633. He had numerous transactions in land on Patuxent River, in Calvert County, Maryland, between that date and 1671, when he is believed to have migrated to Newport, R.I., about the time of his marriage to Katherine Chatham. He was living at Newport at the time of the birth of his sons, Henry in 1673 and George in 1677-see &ldquo;Savage&rsquo;s Dictionary of First Settlers&rdquo;, V. 2, p.487.</p>

<p>He was one of the 56 persons to whom on 06 Nov 1684, William Bradford and associates conveyed lands which included the present site of New Bedford (Dartmouth), Mass., which they had previously purchased from the Indians. Upon division, each purchaser received 800 acres. Valentine Huddleston lived and died there, as did several generations of his descendants. Notes: Katherine Chatham was the widow of John Chamberlain, by whom she had Henry, b. 1659; William, b. 1661; Susannah, b. 1664; Peleg, b. 1666; Jane, b. 1667. Her sons lived in Monmouth, N.J. beginning about 1680.- &ldquo;Historical Misc.&rdquo;, by Stillwell, 248; 3 ib. pgs. 158-161. Catherine also had 5 of John Chamberlains children from his previous marriage to Mary brown in Bucks Co. Pa. John Chamberlain was originally from Burlington Co. New Jersey.</p>

<p>With Catherine’s children by John, (4) and John’s 5 children with Mary Brown, Valentine would have instantly had a large family, the addition of his own three made 11 children that Valentine helped to raise.</p>

<p>See N.E. Historical Genealogical Register, V. 20. Valentine Huddleston was born in 1628 and died in 1727 and married Katherine (Chatham) Chamberlain. Children of Valentine and Katherine (Chatham) Huddleston were: Henry born 1673 and married Sarah Case, George born 1677 and married Mary Case and Katherine who married Joseph Collins in 1698. Notes: George Huddleston was living in Dartmouth, Mass on 15 Dec. 1715, on which date his father Valentine Huddleston deeded him part of his original &ldquo;800 acres&rdquo; for the settling of his son George for the future. Sarah and Mary (Case) Huddleston were daughters of James Case, and witnessed a deed in 1719. Mary was wife of George and he and Henry having married sisters. Children of George and Mary (Case) Huddleston were: Isaac, who married Eleanor Mortimer and Richard, who married Sarah Tallman.</p>

<p>Valentine Huddleston&rsquo;s son George, with his family, appeared to have disappeared out of Massachusetts about 1730. It is possible that they may have found a group or groups in other colonies. Henry&rsquo;s descendants are scattered through the States. A large group of them now reside in Eastern Indiana. The 1790 Census shows Peleg, with a family of 3 males and 3 females, in Bristol County, Mass and Seth in Guilford County, N.C.
No research has been done on Seth’s father Seth Huddleston and his mother Elizabeth Fish.</p>
