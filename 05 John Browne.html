            <h2>John Bowne</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The following story is an example of how this “freedom” had to be won even in this land. John Bowne’s story is taken from the “Cox Family in America “ Allied families Appendix pgs 282-84 written and researched by Henry Miller Cox. The Cox line is traced through Edith Cadwallader Huddleston – later Summerfruit, who’s mother was Martha Cox and father was Isaac Cadwallader, these ancestors were also from descendant Quaker lines. The story of John Bowne is widely known and the home where he worshiped according to his faith has been turned into a museum and still stands in Queens, New York. More information about this house and John Bowne can be found at this internet site <a href="http://www.bownehouse.org/">http://www.bownehouse.org/</a> .</p>

<p>John married twice into our Quaker lines. He married first Hanna Feake, daughter of John Feke and Elizabeth Prior and then married James Cox’s daughter, Mary Cox. So he would be a great uncle – on two different occasions.

<p>I include the story as researched by Henry Miller Cox from The Cox Family in America – primitive spelling and language intact taken from ancient records.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Bowne was born Matlock, Derbyshire, England, 9th of Third Month(? Mar. or May 1627 and baptized in Matlock Parish Church 29th same month, son of Thomas Bowne, baptized there May 25, 1595.    Thomas Bowne with his children John and Dorothy came to New England in the latter part of 1648 or early in 1649. In October 1650, John, leaving behind his father and sister, returned to England, and again arrived in Boston in May 1651. In June of the same year he visited Flushing, L.I. in company with his brother in-law, Edward Farrington, who had married his sister, Dorothy, probably during his absence in England) and seems to have been much pleased with the place, as he removed thither shortly after to live.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May, 1656, he married Hannah Feake, b(supposed) at Watertown, Mass;, and about 1637 and after living for a time at Greenwhich, Conn., and New London, came to Flushing, with her mother, brothers, and sister, before 1649.   She was daughter of Lieutenant Robert Feake and Elizabeth (Fone) Winthrop, his wife.</p>

<p>John Bowne was at this time in the 29th year of his age and his worth and personal attractions were such as to elicit the favorable notice and commendation of Capt. John Underhill, then living at Southold, L.I., who writing from that place under date of April 12, 1656, to John Winthrop Jr., at Pequot, (New London), thus acquaints him with the new engagement; &ldquo;Sir, I was latli at Flushing. Hannah Feke is to be married to a verri jentiel young man of gud abilliti, of lovli fetture and gud behafior.&rdquo; As Hannah had made the acquaintance of some of the Friends who were holding meetings for worship in the woods, she soon became a member; and her husband, as he himself relates, on occasion going out of curiosity to look at them when assembled together, was so powerfully affected by the beauty and simplicity of their worship that he invited them to hold their meetings for the future at his house. It was not long before he joined them himself, not merely, as he states, from kindness and affection to his wife, but his judgment was convinced of the truth of the principles they held forth. Meetings had not long been held at John Bowne&rsquo;s house before complaints were made &ldquo;by the Magistrates of Flushing Aug. 24, 1663 that many of the inhabitants are followers of the Quakers who hold their meetings at the house of John Bownne.&rdquo; An ordinance of the West India Company of 1662 provided that &ldquo;besides the Reformed religion no conventicles should be holden in houses, barns, ships, woods or fields, under the penalty of fifty guilders for the first offence, double for the second and arbitrary correction for every other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the authority of this ordinance we find that great numbers, including many women, suffered severely both by direct action of the Governor, and his courts had at Gravesend. John Bowne was arrested, ninth month 1st 1662, charged with &ldquo;harboring Quakers and permitting them to hold meetings at his house.&rdquo; He was then taken a prisoner to Fort Amsterdam, and on the 14th of the same month, the &ldquo;court held by the Lords, Director General and Council at Fort Amsterdam in the Netherland&rdquo; entered the following judgment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because John Bowne, at present prisoner, dwelling at Flushing upon Long Island, has made no scrupple in vilipendation of the orders and mandates of the Director General and Council of the New Netherland, we do in justice to the high and mighty states of the United Provinces and the administrators of the West India Company of the Chamber of Amsterdam having heard the demand of the substitutes, and the acknowledgement of the prisoner, have condemned and do condemn the said John Bowne by these present boete (penalty)-5 and 20 pounds Flemish with the charges of the Justician, and with express admonition and interdict to abstain from all such forementioned meetings and conventicles, or else for the second boete, he be condemned in a double boete, and for the third boete to be banished out of this province of New Netherland.&rdquo; John Bowne refused to pay the fine, and was then confined in a dungeon and restricted to bread and water, no person whatever being allowed to speak with him. As this did not change his steadfastness of purpose he was sometime afterward taken to the Stadthause and put in the prison there, and allowed to see his wife and other friends. He was then notified that the Court had resolved that he must pay the fine that had been imposed or be sent out of the country; or he would be set free if he would promise to leave the country in three months. He still remained firm in his purpose not to compromise his principles in any way. On Tenth mo.21st he was permitted to visit his friends under a promise to return in three days, and on the 31stof that month he was put on board ship and sent a prisoner to Holland. He arrived at Amsterdam on the 29th of Second mo. 1663.</p>

<p>The following statement was forwarded by the authorities of New Netherlands to the West India Company; &ldquo;Honorable, Right Respectable Gentlemen. We omitted in our general letter the trouble and difficulties which we and many of our good inhabitants have since sometimes met with, and daily are renewed by the sect called Quakers, chiefly in the county and principally in the English villages, establishing forbidden conventicles and frequenting these against our public placards, and disturbing in a manner the public peace, in so far that several of our magistrates and well affectioned subjects remonstrated and complained to us from time to time of their insufferable obstinacy, unwilling to obey our orders or judgment.  Among other has one of their principle leaders named John Bowne, who for his transgressions was, in conformity to the placards, condemned to an amends of 150 Guilders in suevant, who has been now under arrest more than three months for his unwillingness to pay, obstinately persisting in his refusal, in which he still continues, so that we at last resolved, or were rather compelled to transport him in this ship from this province in the hope that others by it be discouraged. If nevertheless, by these means no more salutary impression made upon others we shall, though against our inclinations be compelled to prosecute such persons in a more severe manner, and which we previously solicit to be favored with your &quot;Honour&rsquo;s wise and forseeing judgement. With which after our cordial salutations we recommend your Honours to God&rsquo;s protection, and remain, Honourable and Right Respectable Gentemen, your Honour&rsquo;s faithful servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officials of the West India Company considered the case and drew up a paper for John Bowne to sign. In reply he sent to the Company the following dignified statement: &ldquo;Friends, the paper drawn up for me to subscribe I have perused and weighed, and do find the same not according to that engagement to me through one of your members, viz: that he or you would do therein by me as you would be done unto, and not otherwise. For which of you being taken from your wife and family, without just cause, would be bound from returning to them unless upon terms to act contrary to your conscience, and deny your faith and religion, yet this in effect do you require of me and not less.</p>

<p>But truly, I cannot think that you did in sober earnest ever think I would subscribe to any such thing, it being the very thing for which I rather chose freely to suffer want of the company of my dear wife and children, imprisonment of my person, the ruin of my estate in my absence there, and the loss of my goods here, than to yield or consent to such an unreasonable thing as you thereby enjoin me unto. For which I am persuaded you will not only be judged in the sight of God, but by good and godly men, rather to have mocked at the oppressions of the oppressed and added afflictions to the afflicted than herein to have done to me as you in the like case would be done unto, which the royal cause of our God requires. I have with patience and moderation waited several weeks expecting justice from you, but behold an addition to my oppression in the measure I receive. Wherefore I have this now to request for you, that the Lord will not lay this to your charge, but to give eyes to see and hearts to do justice, that you may find mercy with the Lord in the day of judgment.</p>

<p>In the Fourth mo. John Bowne was released. He returned to America by the way of England and the Island of Barbadoes, but did not reach Flushing until first mo. 30th, 1664. The authorities in Amsterdam sent to the officials in New Netherlands the following decision, dated Amsterdam, April 16, 1663: &quot;We, finally, did see from your last letter, that you had exiled and transported hither a certain Quaker named John Bowne, and although it is our cordial desire that similar and other sectarians might not be found there, yet as the contrary seems to be the case, we doubt very much if rigourous proceedings against them ought not to be discontinued except you intend to destroy your population, which however, in the youth of your existence, ought rather to be encouraged by all possible means.</p>

<p>Wherefore, it is our opinion that some connivance would be useful that the consciences of men, at least, ought ever to remain free and unshackled. Let everyone be unmolested as long as he is modest as long as he does not disturb others or oppose the government. This maxim of moderation has always been the guide of the magistrates of this city, and the consequence has been that from every land people have flocked to this asylum. Tread thus in their steps and we doubt not you will be blessed.</p>

<p>(Signed) The directors of the West India Company Amsterdam Department Abraham Wilmandonk

<p>This document has peculiar historic interest because of the fact that it was one of the first official proclamations of religious liberty for any part of America, the establishment of religious liberty in Maryland by Lord Baltimore, (a catholic) having antedated it. With this decree the persecution of Friends on Long Island ceased.</p>

<p>While in Holland John Bowne wrote letters to his wife and numbers of Friends, which are still preserved. They are remarkable for the illustrations they give of unflinching steadfastness of purpose, for the beautiful and lofty ideas expressed in them, and for their elegant and sometimes scholarly diction. In one of these he said: &ldquo;Dear George Fox and many more Friends desire their love and tender salutations remembered to all Friends.&rdquo; From this we may infer that he was visited at Amsterdam by George Fox and others.</p>

<p>Hannah, wife of John Bowne, became more and more zealous in religious devotion and having &ldquo;received a gift in the ministry,&rdquo; she, in earlier part of the year 1675, left her home to pay a religious visit to Friends in Great Britain. The letters of her husband sent to her there are admirable in their expression of tender affection of interest in her religious service. In one of these he quaintly remarks: &ldquo;Dear heart, to particularize all that desire to be remembered to thee would be exceedingly large, but this I may say for all Friends in general, relations and neighbors, and people, the like largeness of love for one particular person I have seldom found amongst them, as it is for thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He joined his wife in her religious service in England in the year 1676 and accompanied her through England and Holland. Returning to London at the beginning of winter of 1677 she was taken sick with a fatal fever and died at the house of their friends, John and Mary Elson, at the Peel Meeting Place, in St. John Street, London, on the 31st of Eleventh Month (Jan.) 1677-8</p>

<p>John Bowne took with him on this journey the following minute of approval. &ldquo;In the Men&rsquo;s and Women&rsquo;s Meeting on Long Island in America. These are to certify to all whom it may concern that our dear and well beloved Friend, John Bowne, of Flushing (his occasion at this time requiring his being in Ould England by the first conveyance) is for his life and conversation un-blamable and of good report, and is likewise in true love and unity with all Friends in the truth here, as by large experience we have all found and witnessed.&rdquo; (Signed by many Friends)</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Bowne dyed the 20 day of the 10 month in the year 1695 and was buryed ye 23 day of the same being about 68 years of age he did Feely Expose himself his house and Estate to ye service of Truth and had a constant Meeting In his house near about forty years he also suffered very much for ye truths seak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was thrice married. His second wife was Hannmah Bickerstaff who brought a certificate from Tupton in Derbyshire, England. They m. 1679 He m. 3rd 26/4 mo. June 1693 Mary Cock. Mary Cock was daughter of James Cox &amp; Sarah Clarke, of our ancestral lineage.</p>
