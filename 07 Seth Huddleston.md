(as written by Samuel Huddleston)


The year 1776 was one of struggle, not only for the life of a new born Nation, but it was a year of struggle against starvation with almost everybody in New England. The people were taxed to their utmost to provide for the army, and especially was it hard for the Quakers and Tories to make a living. These two classes, though their sympathies were entirely unlike, were classed together, and the Revolutionists were against them with more bitterness and hatred than they felt toward the English in arms. The Tories of Revolutionary times were those who favored England against the Colonies, and the anti-war Quakers were generally desirous of freedom and independence but opposed to war. But, as already stated, this difference was not noticed by the Revolutionists, and they did all they could to force them to help carry on the war by taking from them everything that the army could use. In those days the butchers, on account of the scarcity of meat and money, sold “Soup Privileges/” that is, they came around with their beef wagon or cart twice a week, and the people knowing just when to expect them would have a kettle of water boiling over a hot fire. The butcher sold them the privilege of boiling a certain amount and quality of meat five, ten, or fifteen minutes, according to the number of pennies they could pay. When the privilege thus sold was fulfilled the butcher would take his meat out of the kettle, leaving nothing but the soup, and placing it again in his wagon he would hurry away to the next customer, who would be anxiously awaiting his coming. A few families that were more prosperous got the meat after the substance had been all boiled out of it. Other provisions were as scarce and hard to get as meat, but Seth Huddlestone and his wife struggled on, and in the course of a few years they became prosperous farmers, and in 1781 they bought the entire farm of their uncle, Benjamin Gifford, and the deed, of which the following is a certified copy, is on record in Bristol County, Massachusetts, book 65, page 105, and it has never been transferred from him.

We do not know whether the Abiel Gifford mentioned in the above deed was Seth Huddleston’s father-in-law or whether that is a mispell for Abigal. It is possible that Abiel was Lydia’s father, and her mother’s name was not Abigal. We will make an effort to find out from the county records the truth of these names and will publish the result in the future. Seth Huddlestone did not live in Massachusetts many years after he came in possession of this farm, but we do not know the exact date of his removal. John J. Nelson, present Clerk of the Superior Court of Guilford County, North Carolina, writes from Greensboro, June 26, 1891, in reply to our inquiry concerning his farm in that county: “I find on record a deed from George Mendenhall to Seth Huddlestone, February 5, 1788.” We think it is almost certain that he settled in the vicinity of this farm which was in Deep River Settlement at what was known as William Beard’s Hatter Shop, not many months and perhaps only a few days before he made this purchase.

We also know that he did serve in the Revolutionary War from these records that Leah Huddleston obtained. Huddleston,Seth:	Descriptive list of men mustered in Bristol County, Mass. By James Leonard Muster Master to serve in the Continental Army for the term 9 months from the time of their arrival at Springfield, dated Oct 29, 1779:13 co. Col. Hathaway’s regt.: age 33 yrs; stature 5 ft.6 in; complexion, dark; hair, black; eyes dark; engaged for town of Dartmouth.

When Seth Huddlestone moved from Massachusetts to North Carolina he believed that human slavery would soon expire of its own self, and it was this general belief among the Quakers that caused them to settle so thickly in Guilford and Randolph counties in North Carolina; but when they saw slavery growing stronger, and when they had become convinced that there was, and would be for years to come, a slave-owning and slave-trading South, and a freedom-loving North, the Quakers of North Carolina began to emigrate to the wilderness of the Northwest. But before Seth Huddleston could make the transition from North Carolina to regions farther north he died of typhoid fever September 7, 1791, aged 48 years, 3 months, and 26 days.

 Three years later we find that Seth Huddlestone made a will, of which the following is a certified copy from the county records at Greensboro, North Carolina:
