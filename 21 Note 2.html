            <p>NOTE #2</p>

<p><em>I include this Declaration in regards to the man who came to Howard about joining his polygamous community. The following is an official declaration made by President Wilford Woodruff in 1890 regarding polygamy. There were some members of the Church who were so committed to the practice that they refused to obey this declaration. Those members who were non compliant with this manifesto were then summarily
ex-communicated from the Church and the Church has no affiliation with them whatsoever. The earlier beliefs cause some confusion in today’s world, as many fundamentalists are practicing polygamy – they are in no way affliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.</em></p>

<h1>Official Declaration 1</h1>

<p>To Whom It May Concern</p>

<p>Press dispatches having been sent for political purposes, from Salt Lake City, which have been widely published, to the effect that the Utah Commission, in their recent report to the Secretary of the Interior, allege that plural marriages are still being solemnized and that forty or more such marriages have been contracted in Utah since last June or during the past year, also that in public discourses the leaders of the Church have taught, encouraged and urged the continuance of the practice of polygamy-</p>

<p>I, therefore, as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, do hereby, in the most solemn manner, declare that these charges are false. We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory.</p>

<p>One case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the marriage was performed in the Endowment House, in Salt Lake City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without delay.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise. There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey any such teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff</p>

<p>President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Lorenzo Snow offered the following
&ldquo;&lsquo;I move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the only man on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the sealing ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his position to issue the Manifesto which has been read in our hearing, and which is dated September 1890, and that as a Church in General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning plural marriages as authoritative and binding.&rsquo;
&quot;The vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous. &quot;Salt Lake City, Utah, October 6, 1890.</p>
