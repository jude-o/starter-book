            <h1>The Early Life of Edith Huddleston Summerfruit</h1>

<p>I was born January 4th 1873. My father was in the civil war. He had charge of the commissary Department and fed the soldiers well. He was well educated. He had been an orator, and when young, was called upon in many public meeting places to recite the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>He also impersonated Shakespeare plays. This is where I inherited my talent for acting. After the war, his trade was cabinet maker, finisher and sign painter. In those days, all such work was done by hand.</p>

<h2>Edith</h2>

<p>My mother was a woman of 40 when she married my father. He was a widower with three children. My mother was educated in all the rudiments of music while she lived in the home of a German professor for four years. On her 18th birthday her</p>

<p>father gave her a fine piano. It was a Knabe which was made in Baltimore. I still have that piano. Mother would never part with it under any circumstances. It is now 142 years old and will be left to my daughter, who is also a musician both in piano and violin. She has written several songs; both words and music. My mother was a wonderful woman. She never whipped or scolded me. She was always kind and loving. She taught me the right and wrong ways of life and I never disobeyed her counsel. She passed beyond at the age of 81. She was a wonderful, Christian example to me.</p>

<h2>Martha Cox</h2>

<p>The first Christmas I remember was before my third birthday. It was a different Christmas from the Christmas of these days. My brothers planned it all. They found a tree from the woods and strung popcorn on it. We hung a few candles shaped like slipper boots and an angel. There were wax candles tied onto the tree, which we had to blow out for fear of fire. On
Christmas Eve, I was sitting on my father&rsquo;s lap in the next room warming my feet by an old fireplace when we heard a noise. &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; my father said, &ldquo;I think I hear Santa&rsquo;s whistle.&rdquo; Then we heard it farther away. &ldquo; I guess he&rsquo;s gone now, let&rsquo;s go in and see.&rdquo; I was thrilled at the sight. My faith in Santa Claus was established at this time. This simple child-like faith grew to a faith in God. A faith developed from not seeing, yet believing in his wondrous love and guidance through all the difficulties in life. (Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.)</p>

<p>I must give a few incidents of my child life to show that I was original in my ideas and my plan to carry them out. I remember at the age of five, my playmate took me to school to visit. On Friday they did recitations and when the teacher asked for volunteers I raised my hand to say, &ldquo;I know a piece.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo; Recite it, and I&rsquo;ll give you this big bouquet on my desk.&rdquo; I marched to the platform, put in plenty of gestures and expressions and got my bouquet. This was my first thrill of doing something important.</p>

<p>When I started school, they sang a song to anyone late. It was &ldquo; A Tardy Scholar Is Your Name.&rdquo; I lived but a square away from school; but I waited until I heard the last bell ring, and then I&rsquo;d run to school. By the time I arrived they were all in their seats, so they sang me this song. I&rsquo;d sing the second verse and act like I was crying. &ldquo;That is just the way, you see, always making fun of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I was 9 years old, there was an announcement in the newspaper, about a lady to who was to speak at the Y.M.C.A. She was organizing a class in elocution, which was the name for dramatizations at that time. My mother took me to hear her. I was so interested, I wanted to speak to her, so I pulled at her dress as she passed my seat. She asked my mother, &ldquo; What does your little girl want?&rdquo; My mother was timid. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;my daughter is so interested, I would like for you to give her lessons. I am a music teacher, I don&rsquo;t get paid much. Her father died two years ago, but I will pay you as soon as I can.&rdquo; The lady held my hand. &ldquo; Bless her heart, &rdquo; she said, &ldquo; you bring her to my apartment next week.&rdquo; She gave lessons free of charge to the children in her class that she saw had talent. She offered my mother $10 per week to let me travel with her, but my mother refused, for fear I might go wrong. I needed my mother&rsquo;s advice and love.</p>

<p>One more incident of my child life. A gentleman came to our city and advertised for 300 children to produce a Cantata. It was to be all singing and acting - representing spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I was at the age of 10 years. I tried out and my part was summer. We were girls on a picnic serving a widow lunch. There were faeries for spring, jolly imps for fall, snowstorms and trouble for winter. It was the finest home talent ever produced in our city in the best opera house. The manager wanted someone to recite the opening address. Some of the older girls came with their mothers to try out. I went to the manager afterwards and asked if I could try for the address. He looked me over and said, &ldquo; You? All right, get up there and let me see what you can do.&rdquo; If I ever put my soul into my work it was now. My teacher had trained me well. I impersonated a street sweeper in New York. When I came back to my seat he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know later.&rdquo; We practiced for one week and on Saturday, at the last rehearsal, I asked the manager if he had decided who was to give the opening address. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo; I wanted you from the first, but forgot to give you the part. It&rsquo;s very important as it describes the whole play and you cannot have it committed to memory by Monday, for the dress rehearsal.&rdquo; &ldquo; Let me try&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo; I studied all day Sunday and was ready for the dress rehearsal on Monday. He said to speak it is just as I had studied it and if he had any changes he would tell me then. He said he wouldn&rsquo;t change it and it had never been given better by any child. When the curtain rolled, I was at the front with the entire cast in the rear- faeries, spirits, maids, flowers, fountains representing the Garden of Eden. This was my first start in the things I wanted to do in my life.</p>

<p>When I was 13, I was converted and joined the Methodist Church and lived to the best knowledge of right living. I attended all services of the church, I didn&rsquo;t go to dances or play cards. I was secretary of the band of hope, a temperance club. The president, a boy two years older, would ask to walk me home under his umbrella if it was raining. I never drank any intoxicating liquor and never smoked cigarettes. I often spoke for church entertainments and won medals in Demarest contests on temperance.</p>

<p>At 17, I dramatized Little Women from the book and produced it on the stage with my class in dramatic Art. It was a success. The life of the young people was so much different in my time. There were no moving pictures, and no drinking parties, the young folks have more temptation now. Girls run after men- there&rsquo;s too much petting and they think sex appeal means love but it doesn&rsquo;t last.</p>

<p>I had my first romance at 18 years of age at a church social. There was a spring carnival for the young folks. We girls were to trim a hat and make a bow tie for a boy out of the same material. They were to pick up the tie at the door and find our partner for the evening by matching the material on the hat. I wore a bonnet shaped with pink muslin and a large butterfly in the back. When I bowed the wings would flap up and down. I made a small butterfly tie. I spied my partner, but stayed in the rear. Finally he found me and exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, here is my butterfly.&rdquo; We spent an enjoyable evening and many evenings after. We had prayer meetings on Thursday at my home. On Friday evening we went driving and for walks in the park on Sunday afternoons. We had some good times. I liked him fine. He was from a fine family. His brother was a reporter for our paper. We had many things in common. I liked to talk to him about my work and what I wanted to do with my life. I intended to go to Indianapolis to train as a kindergarten teacher because I loved children and was interested in them. We had good times all summer; and, in the fall, he didn&rsquo;t want me to leave town, so he proposed marriage. I wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up my work as I wanted to make my life worthwhile- do something important- before I settled down to marriage, housekeeping and children. I felt that after marriage I would need to devote all my time to being a good wife and mother. It would be important for me to teach my children the ways of life- as my mother had taught me; and to remain at home and live the kind of example that I wished my children to live. My friend and I parted; not knowing what the future would be.</p>

<p>I entered the school for training. We took our lessons in the afternoon and taught classes in the mornings as dictated the day before. I won at &ldquo;best for organization&rdquo; and &ldquo;holding children&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo; When I returned home, I taught the first kindergarten in the public schools of Richmond, Indiana. I taught a private class in my home in the afternoon. I did this for several years. I saw there was a need for a free kindergarten in the extreme west end of the city as well as the North, so I had tables and benches made by donation and held classes in the basement of the old church where I first went to Sunday school. This was the year 1880. The city furnished street car tickets for the children as I lived in the east end of town. I didn&rsquo;t expect any pay but the church people made me a purse of $50- which was a nice sum in those days.</p>

<p>I loved my work and was happy to be doing something for others as well. Then I began to think; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting older, almost 24 years of age.&rdquo; Girls who were not married at 25 were considered an old maid. I didn&rsquo;t want to be thought of as an old maid; so I thought I&rsquo;d better find a husband. I decided that he must be a man from a good family, have a secure business, must not drink liquor or use tobacco.</p>

<p>I met a gentleman, who was a student at the Medical College; but he was a jealous person. We were at a lodge social and I happened to speak to a friend I knew. When we returned home that night he said, &ldquo;You did something I couldn&rsquo;t stand. You spoke to a man and smiled where everyone saw you. They knew you were engaged to me.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, that is nothing more than I would do as if we were married. I&rsquo;ll always speak to old friends.&rdquo; We broke up after that.</p>

<p>When I went to Earlham College to take oratory and literature, I met the nephew of the President of the college. He was my instructor. All of our conversation was strictly literary during class. He was educated, a musician, and an elocutionist. One could hardly believe that he could be so foolish, but when studies were over, and we were at my home, in the moonlight, he would look up at the stars and say, &ldquo;Do you love that special star?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why yes,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;I love all of God&rsquo;s wonderful universe.&rdquo; &ldquo; But I mean that one.&rdquo; He would point up to the sky. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d say. Then he would remark, &ldquo; I wish I was that star.&rdquo; I thought that was so silly. He told me his family was English, and were very reserved. He said his mother lived in New York. His grandparents lived in Michigan and he made his home with his grandparents. His family planned that he and his cousin should be married to keep the property and family tradition; but he didn&rsquo;t like the idea. He said I was just what I was and wasn&rsquo;t trying to cover up anything. That was what he liked about me: I was an open book. I wasn&rsquo;t interested in his theory, but all my friends said, &ldquo;Look at his standing, his education.    You shouldn&rsquo;t turn him down.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He planned that we would take a camping trip to see the lakes and go to New York to visit his mother before our wedding. His sister, his cousin and wife were our chaperones. We rented a cottage for one week. We had a fine time fishing, boating, and eating. When the week was over, we wanted to stay longer but he neglected to extend the time. Another couple had rented the cottage so we needed to vacate. He sat outside the cottage and said, &ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Get out, of course.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go home.&rdquo; His grandmother said, &ldquo; I&rsquo;m glad Robert is going to marry someone that has such push about them, he&rsquo;s always depending on someone.&rdquo; He said he wished someone would send him a hundred pounds. I didn&rsquo;t know how much that was. He had a chance to teach literature where he had graduated but failed to apply in time. He wrote me we would have to live in Michigan in his grandmother&rsquo;s home. It was all too much, so I answered I would release him from our engagement. As I saw the situation, I would have to do the pushing, leave my dear old mother, and be with people I didn&rsquo;t understand. It was not worth getting a husband. I didn&rsquo;t love him. In fact, I&rsquo;d thought real love was just in storybooks. I certainly hadn&rsquo;t found a man that was intended for me.</p>

<p>Well, when you least expect it, the magic happens. One of my pupils lived in the country. At the close of the school year her parents had an entertainment and I was asked to recite. On the night of the entertainment, the mother came to me saying a young man, who worked for her daughter&rsquo;s grandparents, was coaching the play. &ldquo;My,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a handsome man.&rdquo; When the show was over, I saw him watching me. I was also watching him. My pupil introduced me to all the boys, but didn&rsquo;t introduce me to the one person I really wanted to meet (In those days we would be very much out of place if we spoke to a gentleman without an introduction.) Finally, he came up to where we were standing and so she had to introduce us. [This was Walter Murray Huddleston.] Later in the evening, when I was alone, he came to me saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I met you and would like to see you home.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo; I came with a group and must go home with them to Pearl&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Can you stay a few days? There is going to be a reunion here in two more days.&rdquo; I told him I wasn&rsquo;t invited. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want to see you again.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t tell the girls that he talked to me; but when we got home they said &ldquo;Why not stay a few days with us and attend the reunion?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I might.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m having a good time.&ldquo;</p>

<p>I went to the reunion, but didn&rsquo;t see Murray anywhere until I was on the platform reciting &quot;Them Oxen.&rdquo; He was 6 ft. 2 in. and stood out standing on the back bench. When I saw him, it shocked me so I forgot my lines, but recovered so that no one noticed. After the program, he walked up to me and said, &ldquo;Well, you got to come. I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thirsty, is there any water out here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Over there in the barrel.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t offer to get me a drink and I thought, &ldquo;You independent guy!&rdquo; Some other boys came over and asked me to have some ice cream. I refused, then he came up and said, &ldquo;There is a church social at Whitewater tonight. I&rsquo;ll take you girls over there and give you all you can eat. There will be lots of ice cream, watermelon, candy, and anything you want.&rdquo; We went; and a good many people we had met at the reunion were there. They kept yelling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget &lsquo;Them Oxen,&rdquo; which is what I had recited at the picnic. Pearl and I began talking about making a trip up north to Winchester, Mt. Pleasant and Ridgeville, Indiana. Murray suggested we borrow his pony and buggy. &ldquo; She is gentle and you should have fun.&rdquo; He would go to Alba, on horseback, and we were to send him a note when we returned. So it was settled. We took our trip; and when we got to Alba, sure enough, there he was. He drove us home to Pearl&rsquo;s folks leading the horse behind. It was quite late when we got there and I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t come in, but he said, &ldquo;A few minutes to say good night and I enjoyed the trip.&rdquo; After he said goodnight he whispered to me, &ldquo; Will you walk as far as the gate with me? I want to ask some questions.&rdquo; &ldquo;You already said good night,&rdquo; I replied; but he said &ldquo;Please, it&rsquo;s only a few steps.&rdquo; As soon as we were alone, he said, &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m going with Pearl.&rdquo; I nodded. Everywhere we&rsquo;d gone, she&rsquo;d said, &ldquo;This pony and buggy belongs to my boyfriend.&rdquo; Murray laughed. &ldquo;She is only a school girl. I kid her a lot, just in fun; but she&rsquo;s too young for me. I like an older girl who is more settled. If you stay until tomorrow, we are threshing at her grandfather&rsquo;s and they will have a fine dinner. I&rsquo;ll drive you to town in the evening.&rdquo; Well, I stayed; and as I stood on the porch and watched him on the thresher all covered with dirt, I thought, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he handsome?&rdquo; Here I was falling in love with a poor farm hand and didn&rsquo;t know him or his people or what his habits were. Strange isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>The drive home that evening was wonderful. He told me about his people who lived in Dublin, Indiana. They were Christians, which made me happy. He said he left home to get a start for himself, but wasn&rsquo;t making much money. Farmhands worked very cheap those days, but got plenty to eat.</p>

<p>From that time on, I thought a lot about Murray. It seemed he was interested in my work and liked my mother. (Mother and I lived alone.) He came down about three evenings a week. I told him about my life; that I had been engaged twice, but could not go through with it. He said he wasn&rsquo;t going to give me a chance to turn him down, he&rsquo;d marry me first. He said&quot; You don&rsquo;t want to be an old maid, do you?&ldquo; It &rsquo;s so different when it&rsquo;s true love- like God is in the union; and then it makes no difference about the high standards we set. There is only one sentimental, true love. There are other loves, such as respect, goodness, kindness; but when you&rsquo;re older, true love hits you harder. I am convinced about true love. Murray and I were married in three months; and I thought I knew him.</p>

<p>Well, we didn&rsquo;t have a big wedding with the fancy clothes I wanted when I was younger. We were married at home. No one was present but the preacher and my dear mother. It seemed so solemn, I cried in my flowers. We drove to his father&rsquo;s home in the same little buggy and pony we rode in when we met. His parents, brothers, and cousins were all there to meet us. My father-in-law had a long white beard like my dearly departed father, and I told him, &quot;It&rsquo;s like getting my daddy again.&rdquo; &ldquo;God bless you, daughter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;We love you like our own.&rdquo; Then I said, &ldquo;I want to start our first night together with family prayer.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;We will do that. We have neglected it lately.&rdquo; He got down the old Bible, read a chapter and had prayer. We stayed one week, then went down the hills to a little town called Metamora where his sister and husband lived. They were both physicians. We stayed a week, then returned to his father&rsquo;s home for Thanksgiving. We all went to church and father Huddleston said, as we walked along, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud of our children.&rdquo; After the services Walter and I traveled to our own home in the city. I had receptions given me by my relatives and friends; one from my drama class, one from my kindergarten class. I got some beautiful presents. My husband promised to join the church the first Sunday and he did so. We were very happy.</p>

<p>Why does sorrow come so soon to blight the happiness? The very next year our baby was born dead. He looked just like his father. We had his picture taken. He weighed 10 lbs. When they buried the baby, I was so grief stricken they thought I wouldn&rsquo;t live. Murray begged me to live for him as he had already given up his baby. He brushed my hair and said he didn&rsquo;t want to lose one hair of my head. I had given up all my public work when I married- as I thought my place was in the home; but without our first child, I was lost. I couldn&rsquo;t content myself, but Murray and I had each other. Then one more year, another baby, a little girl. My husband had just gone to the shop to treat the boys to cigars, when I had to call him home. We had our daughter only one day. She cried for an hour, then was quiet. When I turned the covers down, she was blue. The doctor said it was her heart. &ldquo; Oh,&rdquo; I cried to Murray, &ldquo;You wanted me to live for you and I did. I could have died then; and, now, I can&rsquo;t go on living. I&rsquo;ve brought more trouble for you and myself.&rdquo; Murray said &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that way, dear. We will try not to have any more children, just go places together and have a good time.&rdquo; Well, he tried to make me happy, but still I was not satisfied. I loved children. He said, &ldquo;You cry whenever you see baby clothes on the line.&rdquo; Well, &ldquo;I said, you are not a mother who has lost children.&rdquo; Three years went by. I loved my husband, but there was something missing- the love of a child.</p>

<p>Finally, another baby girl came to us; and everything was all right this time. I had a fear that she would be taken away if she slept too long, so I would wake up to see if she was all right. After the delivery I had to have help until I got stronger. My husband&rsquo;s foreman said he could spare one of his girls to help me out until I was able. Betty was a jolly girl and made things cheerful; but I dismissed her when I was able to take over.</p>

<p>About this time, Murray said his shop work didn&rsquo;t agree with him, so he traveled out of town organizing lodges. I got so lonesome for him; but I had my mother and my baby. He would come home on weekends. In two year’s I was expecting again. Murray was home when I delivered. The doctor said, &ldquo; You sure had a hard delivery.&rdquo; this time it was a boy. &ldquo; Oh, Daddy, &rdquo; I said to Murray, &ldquo;Kiss me. I&rsquo;ve given you the son you wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When my son was two months old, I still had not taken him out. My husband said, &ldquo;I must go early to the Pocahontas Lodge tonight, there is a committee meeting.&rdquo; Well, after he was gone, I got lonely as I had been close to home so long. Murray was out for a good time; and all at once I made up my mind. I thought, &ldquo; I&rsquo;m going to the lodge tonight and take my baby.&rdquo; I left our little girl with my mother. I put the baby in his cab, wheeled him 10 squares, and then up the steps of the lodge to the second floor. I was given out from the trip; and, so, waited in the hall to rest. I heard women&rsquo;s voices when I opened the door of the lodge and wheeled in the cab. There were seven women bowing and talking. This was the committee meeting he told me about. It was early and no men had yet arrived. My husband asked why I came. I said I wanted to be where he was. Everyone got quiet and no one seemed to know what to do. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Murray said, &ldquo;Since you are here, you can play the piano for our drill.&rdquo; So I did. I hadn&rsquo;t been to the lodge for a long time and did not know the new members. After the lodge meeting everyone went out into the dance hall while I sat at the piano.   A man walked up to me and said, &ldquo;My wife and your man are having fun. Let us promenade too.&rdquo; I jerked away and said, &ldquo;I do not know you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo; I&rsquo;m a member.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way people act when men and women meet, but I was never used to that. When the party broke, my husband walked to the door and said, &ldquo;Who all is going my way? Come on.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m going your way and here is your baby. I wheeled him up here, you can wheel him back.&rdquo; The foreman&rsquo;s girl, Betty, the one that had stayed with me, came along with us too; but since she lived farther away than we did, Murray offered to walk her home. I waited for him to return. I looked out the upstairs window for a long time. Finally, I saw my husband and this girl turn west toward her home. Where had they been? Could the rumor that someone told me about her be true? I sat there and waited for what seemed forever. I became numb. I couldn&rsquo;t move. Then I saw Murray walking slowly homeward- his head down. I waited and waited. Surely he will come into our room, I thought, but he didn&rsquo;t. I was exhausted, but crawled to the stairs and down to the living room. There he sat; tears rolling down his cheeks. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; He looked up and exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Tell me what it is.&rdquo; He replied,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my trouble, not yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in trouble, I am too.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell me about it perhaps I can help.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no.&rdquo; &ldquo; He said, &quot;it&rsquo;s my trouble.&rdquo; He wouldn&rsquo;t tell me.</p>

<p>I heard that Betty had gone to her aunt&rsquo;s on a visit. My husband regularly ate in a restaurant in town and did not come home for all of his meals. Then, one day, he didn&rsquo;t return home at all. The next thing I knew I had a letter from him. &ldquo; Dearest,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I love you, but I&rsquo;m not worthy to live in your home. Please forgive me. As soon as I get settled I&rsquo;ll send money for the children.&rdquo; Oh, I was frantic. I called my doctor. He said, &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get a divorce and don&rsquo;t give him one.&rdquo; My father-in-law came to see me and said, &ldquo;Darling daughter, Murray couldn&rsquo;t live up to your standard. Don&rsquo;t give him a divorce and he will come back.&rdquo; I almost lost my mind. Why must this happen to us? We were so happy together. People seemed like pictures to me, passing to and fro. I was under the doctor&rsquo;s care. Betty&rsquo;s father came to me and said, &ldquo;My daughter has left her aunt&rsquo;s home and has gone with your husband. I am sorry. We were brothers in the lodge. Betty knows better- she is past 20 years of age. She has already wrecked three homes; your home, my home, and also her own home. If her husband could find Murray he would kill him.&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s father thought they would be back, but Murray and Betty went to a town in Arkansas, named Mark Tree. This was a town that was so swampy the houses were built on stilts. Betty and Murray both came down with yellow fever and were taken to a Catholic hospital. Murray died that night. He had been gone but four months.</p>

<p>An obituary was printed in our newspaper, and his clothes were sent to his father. I wanted to know the facts, so I wrote to the hospital and sent his photo. I asked if such a man on that date had died. I told them that I was his legal wife. (He had given them his middle name.) I got a return answer saying that it was true, that he had a heart attack, and they had not known what to do after his death. The report from the hospital said his body had been given to the Redmen Lodge for burial. This was all I knew for some time. All I could think was, &ldquo;Why must I bear this burden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day the phone rang. The voice said, &ldquo;This is Betty. I am home and I must see you. Father will not let me leave the place. I have something important to say.&rdquo; She met me at the door and put her arms around me.    &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on living, unless you forgive me. My father said the wages of sin is death. I didn&rsquo;t die but I suffered death. Murray&rsquo;s gone to meet his God. &rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got him and neither have I. It&rsquo;s no use to hold a grudge. I&rsquo;ll forgive you. If we don&rsquo;t forgive, how can we be forgiven?&rdquo; So we cried it out together. The hardest thing I had to do in my Christian life was to forgive the one who wrecked my home. I asked her, &ldquo;Tell me if he ever regretted taking that step?&rdquo; &ldquo;It was all my fault,&rdquo; she said. I worked in that restaurant. I told him we had the name, why not the game; but we left town because he was afraid of my father. After we left Murray would walk the floor, curse me and say, &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for you, I&rsquo;d be with my wife and children &quot;He hated me. God knows, I paid dear for my sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been many years since all this happened. I am now 79; but it breaks my heart to recall it. If I live one more year, I would like to go to New York and take part in the program, &ldquo;Life Begins at 80,&rdquo; and give my old time recitations, read the poems I have written, and tell what I think about the world today.</p>

<p>I am now 82 years old. God has blessed my family. I won out over this heartache through faith and prayer.   I now have a modern home, still do Christian work and am looking for the coming of our Savior, when we will not be married nor given in marriage. We will be with our loved ones and have peace and plenty. There will be no more sorrow or tears. We will be one united family. There will be no more war when our Savior takes control.   Pardon my mistakes and writing. I am old and get nervous. God has been with me and will call me home some day to live forever with my Lord.</p>
