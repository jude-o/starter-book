            <h1>History of the Spencers</h1>

<p><em>Written by Samuel Huddleston</em></p>

<p>My wife’s father James Johnson was born at Portsmouth, Ohio, May 12th, 1819. When a young man he went to Helena, Ark. where he was converted and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church and not long afterwards he was licensed to preach. About this time Luzena, daughter of Rozel Spencer came with her parents from Lewisville, Henry Co., Indiana and settled at the same place. The Spencers were Methodists and Luzena was a young convert. James Johnson and Luzena Spencer were married May 12th, 1844 . To them two daughters were born: Sarah Elizabeth March 7, 1845 and Mary N. August 4, 1847. James S. Johnson died of Typhoid fever Sept. 19, 1847. Luzena’s father having died previously and her mother had returned to Indiana, she to, now a widow hastened to follow her by steamer to Cincinnati and from there to Liberty, Union Co., Indiana by public stage coach. Her baby died in her arms when she was nearing liberty.</p>

<p>On Oct. 12, 1850 Mrs. Johnson married Stephan M. Harrell and at the time of my visit to the Harrell settlement in and near Fairfield they lived on a farm near that town. I took little notice of Miss Johnson at this time for I was paying attention to another girl, a member of my own church and we would have married if her people had not separated us on account of my poverty and their dislike for my mother. Then while I was in the Army fighting for the preservation of our dear old Flag I was induced by a dear lady cousin of my Mother that I first met at the time of my visit in this settlement persuaded me and Miss Johnson to enter into correspondence for pass time and this correspondence brought about our acquaintance which ripened into Matrimony and we were united in marriage on May 12, 1866 at the house of the brides mother at Blooming Grove, Ind.</p>

<p>Many were the people that knew this lady from her childhood who told us that she was one of the first ladies of her circle of acquaintance; a lady loved by all who knew her. She admitted that it was the spirit of loyal patriotism that drew her sympathy to me and it was my letters portraying my devotion to my country, to my Christian experience and the unselfish tone of all my letters that made it easy for me to win her love for me .</p>

<p>We commenced our exchange of letters while I was Chief Nurse in Hospital No. 13. Nashville, Tennessee where I entered a very sick soldier with fever and when I commenced to recover the Surgeon perceiving my skill as a nurse held me there for one year. First as a common assistant, then as a special helping cases of wounded, then in cases of amputation of limbs and then as Chief nurse in charge of all the wounded and then he gave me the special care of all cases of gangrene . This last charge was given me because I never had a case of that common and dreadful wound disease contracted under my care, a disease that came from unclean dressing of wounds.</p>

<p>He was mustered out June 26, 1865. On May 12, 1866, Mr. Huddleston was united in marriage with Miss Sarah E. Johnson of Blooming Grove, Franklin County. It is stated they at once settled in Dublin where they have had their residence continuously to the present-time. Both have been for many years active and influential members of the M. E. Church, Mr. Huddleston having filled almost every position in connection with the administration of the affairs of the congregation to which he belonged. He entertained radical views in the temperance question and in politics was a Prohibitionist.</p>

<p>Mr. Huddleston was in many ways a remarkable man. His early educational advantages were quite limited and when he had grown to manhood could scarcely read or write. However through persistent effort, and the aid of his faithful wife, he finally acquired a fair education, although at an age when most men under like circumstances would have abandoned the undertaking. He was of a literary turn of mind and contributed somewhat extensively to the local papers and other periodicals. Several years ago he wrote &ldquo;Footprints of the Huddleston Family,&rdquo; and later published a book of original poems.</p>

<p>Just prior to his death he completed an extensive history of the Huddleston family, the manuscript of which is now in the hands of Hon. George Huddleston, member of Congress for the Birmingham District, Alabama. He had long been a member of the Indiana Historical Society and had gathered much important data touching on the early settlement, growth and development of the county.</p>

<p>The children of Samuel Brown and Sarah E. Huddleston are:</p>
